VIVIKOLA

About: Vivi Kola Bio is based on our legendary Vivi Kola basic recipe and is made exclusively from organic ingredients. The classic version is available as:
0.33L reusable glass

SINCE 1938
Vivi Kola has been produced 100% in Switzerland since 1938. This is important to us. The uniquely strong taste of the lively Vivi Kola is based on the original recipe, in which only natural flavors are used. For example, we utilize grown kola nuts from Cameroon and fair trade vanilla from Madagascar.

OUR INGREDIENTS:

Transparency and sustainability are important to us, which is why we specifically select the suppliers of our raw materials.
This is the only way we can guarantee our customers the best possible quality and sustainable raw material extraction.

SWISS SUGAR: As a traditional Swiss product, we feel obliged to use 100% Swiss sugar from Swiss sugar beets.
FAIRTRADE KOLA NUTS FROM CAMEROON: As in 1938, our Kola nuts come from Cameroon. The growing region is part of a social project.
ORGANIC VANILLA FROM MADAGASCAR: We are proud that we use Fairtrade certified Bourbon vanilla beans from Madagascar in our Kola.
